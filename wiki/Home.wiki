= jQuery dyndatetime widget Documentation =

== Setup ==
Like any jQuery plugin, you will  need to include the main jQuery script and the plugin script.  In addition, you will also need a language script (/lang/*) and a calendar CSS file (/css/*).  

{{{ <script type="text/javascript" src="dont/forget/to/have/jquery-xxx.js"></script>

<!-- plugin code -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="src/jquery.dynDateTime.js"></script>
<!-- Language specific file for calendar -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="lang/calendar-en.js"></script>

<!-- include one of the CSS styles, or make your own -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="css/calendar-win2k-cold-1.css"/> }}}



== Usage pattern ==
To get a input field have date support using the default options, the usage is simple; first create a textbox:

{{{
<input type="textbox" class="dateField"/>
}}}
Now apply jQuery dyndatetime.  This should be done _after_ the page loads the DOM ( jQuery.ready() ).
{{{
jQuery( "input.dateField" ).dynDateTime();
}}}

And you are done.  If your jQuery string matches multiple inputs, they will *all*   

If you want to configure with options:
{{{
jQuery( "input.dateField" ).dynDateTime(
  showsTime: true,
  ifFormat: "%Y/%m/%d-%H:%M",
  button: ".next()" //next sibling to input field
);
}}}

Easy !
