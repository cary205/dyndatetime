# Information #

This jQuery plugin makes it easy to add date and time selection to textfield inputs.

`jQuery("input.dateField").dynDateTime();`

This example will make all input elements tagged with the dateField class.  There are plenty of options for configuration; see details in documentation.

jQuery has lots of date pickers, but no date- **time** pickers.  This supports date and time, and renders the value to a single field in a configurable format.

# Demo example #
Please see the example page, which is also contained in the release archive.

# History #

It is a fork of Dynarch.com's (LGPL) DHTML Calendar v1.0, and the initial codebase (0.1) is little more then a jQuery wrapper.

The fork source is wonderful tool that ceased LGPL development in 2005.
